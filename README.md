# Hi, I'm Miro 👋  
### Cybersecurity Student | Python & Pentesting Enthusiast

I'm a cybersecurity student with a background in team leadership and customer experience—now channeling that energy into ethical hacking, red teaming, and secure software development.

Currently on parental leave and using every naptime to build skills in:
- 🛠️ Penetration testing & red teaming workflows  
- 🔍 Reverse engineering & binary exploitation  
- 💻 Python scripting & secure coding practices  
- 🌐 Web application security (OWASP Top 10, Burp Suite, etc.)

⚡ Fun fact: I make a mean cup of coffee and can solve a Rubik’s cube in under a minute—working on hacking systems just as fast!
